# CITS3403-Project-2
Game of Quizes

Collaborated work of Tony Guo and Aiden Lewington

A simple web application that will suggest what game is suited for the user based on a variety of questions

page 1.1: login page

page 1.2: registeration page

page 2: Questions (genre selection; with subset of questions for the genre - multiple choice quiz, long answer questions e.g. user specifying types of game, long paragraph about what they think they'd like for manual assessment etc... in the future maybe?)

page 3: Results (what game they'd like -info for game), info about their answer (attribute showing how they got the game), in the future maybe percentage of people for the answer

page 4: Admin (add questions, games, manually assess the long answer questions, add and delete users) optionally: feedback page
