Game of Quizes

Collaborated work of Tony Guo and Aiden Lewington

A simple web application that will suggest what game is suited for the user based on a variety of questions

page 1.1: login page 
page 1.2: registeration page
page 2: Questions (genre selection - with subset of questions for the genre multiple choice quiz - long answer questions e.g. user specifying types of game, long paragraph about what they think they'd like for manual assessment etc... in the future maybe?)
page 3: Results (what game they'd like -info for game), info about their answer (attribute showing how they got the game), in the future maybe percentage of people for the answer
page 4: Admin (add questions, games, manually assess the long answer questions, add and delete users) 
optionally: feedback page
